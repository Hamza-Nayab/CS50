# My CS50 Journey

## Introduction
This repository documents my journey through Harvard's CS50 course. Over the duration of the course, I covered a wide range of topics in computer science and programming, gaining valuable knowledge and skills.

## Course Overview
CS50 is a comprehensive introduction to computer science, covering fundamental concepts and practical skills. The course consists of lectures, problem sets, and a final project. Here's an overview of what I learned each week:

### Week 0: Scratch
- Introduction to programming concepts using Scratch
- Basic control structures: loops, conditionals
- Events, broadcasting, and sprites

... (Weeks 1 to 8) ...

### Week 9: Flask
- Introduction to web development using Flask
- Building web applications with Python
- Handling routes, requests, and responses in Flask
- Key takeaway: Learning the basics of web development with Flask.

### Week 10: Final Project - Discuss 50
- **Discuss 50 Project:** My final project, [Discuss 50](https://github.com/Hamza-Nayab/discuss50), was developed using Flask and Bootstrap. It is a web application where users can register, log in, and provide reviews for each week of the CS50 bootcamp separately. Users can also view previous reviews and navigate through weeks using the navigation bar. The project demonstrates my proficiency in web development with Flask and showcases my problem-solving skills and creativity.

## Conclusion
Completing CS50 has been an enriching experience, equipping me with a solid foundation in computer science and programming. I've gained valuable skills that will serve me well in my future endeavors.
